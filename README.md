The goal of this project was to create code that took data from a physically created pendulum using the microbit. The next step was to create a theoretical model for a pendulum to predict the outcomes. The next step was about taking the data we collected and creating graphs that plotted, time, acceleration, velocity, position, the angle, and then calculated the period. The last step involved using numerical methods to create a model that would show what a pendulum looks like in a perfect world.

How to use our code:

There is nothing required for step 1, 2 or 3 unless you decide to take extra data, which should not be necessary. 
To use step 4, the only function that needs to be used is main() which takes no parameters, it will return all the necessary graphs with labels, titles, and values.

For step 5, the function main() will be used. It will plot all necessary graphs using pen_sim and return them all.
